Indeed, industry has created a variety of computer vision products and services from the traditional area of machine inspection to more recent applications such as video surveillance, or face recognition. In this chapter, several representatives from industry present their views on the use of computer vision in industry. Current research conducted in industry is summarized and prospects for future applications and developments in industry are discussed.",
